This is the file where I'll put all the questions I have about the data as well as questions I'm curious about


I found really cool data relating to FSMCs in Missouri!
- Basically, we have financial data on revenue and expenses going back a few years because every school in Missouri publishes
the Annual Secretary of the Board Report (ASBR)
  - https://apps.dese.mo.gov/ASBR/PublicView.aspx

- We also have a list of approved FSMCs Missouri schools are allowed to contract with
  - https://dese.mo.gov/financial-admin-services/food-nutrition-services/food-service-management-companies
  - The above link contains the name of the FSMC, contract information, and sometimes a website
  - With this information, we can search for them on the internet
      - Once the FSMC's website is found, we can go to the 'Careers' section of their website
      - This allows us to find out where the FSMCs are operating 

Examples of the first few approved FSMCs in the above link:
- 2 Mikes Catering: http://www.twomikescatering.com/program-details.html
  - They seem to be a smaller company so they did not have a hiring section and explicity listed the schools they work with
- Aladdin Food Management Services: https://careers.elior-na.com/Aladdin-Campus-Dining/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=&locationsearch=MO&optionsFacetsDD_department=&optionsFacetsDD_shifttype=&optionsFacetsDD_facility=&optionsFacetsDD_customfield2=
  - A lot of openings, some for university dining.
  # How is the market is for university dining halls structured?
- American Food & Vending/American Dining Creations: https://adc.recruiting.com/jobs?page_size=20&page_number=2&location_state=Missouri&sort_by=start_date&sort_order=DESC
  - Has the city, sometimes the precise location. May not be useful, but may be nice to have
- Ameriserve, Inc.: Still on the website, but I believe they were acquired
- Aramark: https://careers.aramark.com/search?&location=Missouri,+USA&distance=25&category=culinary,food+service,nutrition+++dietetics&type=&sub_category=&industry=#page-top
  - A lot of openings, most openings have the exact location/district listed, but others do not
- A'viands, LLC d/b/a K-12 by Elior: https://careers.elior-na.com/K-12-by-Elior/go/K-12-by-Elior/8775002/25/?q=&sortColumn=referencedate&sortDirection=desc
  - A lot of openings, all the food service openings I've checked have the district or school listed

There's also data relating to contracts that are up to be rebid:
  - https://dese.mo.gov/media/pdf/fsmc-contract-rebid-list-23-24-school-year
  - Has agreement number, Sponsor info, FSMC name, contract type and year
  - I'll try to find data that goes back further to see if we can cement which schools contract with an FSMC

Next steps:
  - Find more concrete data about FSMC status
  - Compare the expenditures/revenues by FSMC schools in all aspects of food lunches
    - Food cost
    - Labor cost 
      - If the school contracts with the SFA, how do they know the labor cost?
    - Admin fees
  - Answer the question of "Do FSMCs increase the entire cost of food service programs"
    - Look at long-term effects
      - Has a school ever declined to renew a contract with an FSMC?
