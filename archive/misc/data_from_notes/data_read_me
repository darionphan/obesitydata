This is the text file that describes the source of the data and the data itself

I also numbered the data sets to make them easier to order

{DATA 001} The first data set is the "Recent Cost and Returns" for soybeans
{DATA 002} The second data set is the "Historical Costs and Returns" for soybeans

They were both found at the following link:

{DATA 003} The third data set is from Farm Service Agency USDA Payments from:
