SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since 1995:
   - Corn subsidies total around $116 billion
   - Wheat subsidies total around $48 billion
   - Soybean subsidies total around $45 billion
- Because they are subsidized, they get planted more >> they get used more in food and animal feed
- Author suspects increase in gluten intolerance/allergies could be due to this
- Soybeans/vegetable oil more generally make up for 20% of American calorie consumption
  - Also used in animal feed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked through the sources and links in the news article and found an interesting Twitter thread by the author in which he talks about how vegetable oil can be detrimental to American health.
https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1329082510714671110?lang=en

The thread turned out to be a summary of a series of articles by Jeff Nobbs. Going through the articles, he makes a strong case for the role vegetable oils play in weight gain and other chronic diseases. 
Part 1 of 6 of the series is linked and the rest of the series is found at the end of each article.

Since we are primarily focusing on obesity, parts 1, 2, 3, and 5 are the most relevant.

#can we use studies by country to see what other countries are consuming vegetable oil in the same quantities the US is?

Part 3 claim: Soybean oil accounts for about 45% of our dietary omega-6 (CHECK THIS LATER)

Links the increase in Omega-6/linoleic acid to weight gain
- There's a lot of evidence for this
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22334255/
- In the "Similar articles" section, there are other articles that state that linoleic acid causes weight gain
  - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24081493/
  - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22883314/
- Affects mortality

#Would transfat be a contributing factor?
#Possibly affect infant health via breast milk?
   # Article suspects the above
   
# Possible experiment?   
# Vegetable oil consumption as it gets introduced to new countries, 
# Maybe opening of borders to new fast food restaurants like McDonalds, KFC in China/other countries > weight gain?
   # This is kind of a subsidy, like "it is now legal to do business in China"
   # What if we looked at tariffs on vegetable oils and looked at the effect on weight?
   
- Article claims that that increase in the consumption of oil causes a reaction that makes us want to eat more (munchies) because people perceive themselves to be hungier

      - This is part 5 of the 6 part series of articles. Part 1 is linked above. 
      
CLOSING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This established that there is a correlation between vegetable oil consumption and weight gain. 
Looking at vegetable oil consumption as it changes with farming subsidies is a direction for future exploration. 
We can also look at the opening of fast food in regions that did not previously have fast food and analyzing the weight gain from that. 
I think there are studies on that already with Middle Eastern countries and Pacific Island nations, but I'll have to double check that.

Looking more directly at the research question of the causes and consequences of obesity in the US, I think another direction we can take this is to analyze soy bean subsidies to farmers and the subsequent prices of soybeans. 
I'm pretty sure that subsidies will affect commodity prices but I'll need to verify that. 
I'll also probably need to understand the specifics of the subsidies to see if they are per-unit of lump-sum and if they are available in all regions of the US.

SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Past agricultural subsidies have incentivized the production of food like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) that lead to obesity
- The corn industry is advocating that corn subsidies is not the only reason for the increase in obesity
- Interesting legislation/papers/websites to look at that were mentioned in the article:
   - Agricultural Credits Act of 1923:
   - Freedom to Farm Act
   - Barry K. Goodwin 
      - https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2a4d353f16d3070afba07848be0403cf31b783f1
      - Agricultural subsidies increase farmland value
   ! Environmental Working Group (EWG) (they have data on a state-by-state basis) 
      ! https://farm.ewg.org/index.php
      # if we determine what areas have the subsidies, would that matter? The agricultural market seems pretty widespread,
      # so would we be able to determine if obesity would be localized to a specific area the subsidies are?   
      # When subsidies are announced/passed, we should see a drop in
- Prices of food are falling, people are becoming misnourished
- "About two-thirds of the HFCS consumed in the United States is in beverages"
- Bruce Babcock, Iowa State University Professor: 
   - "... if corn and soybeans were not subsidized, the price would rise at most by between five and seven percent"
   # It's "unpublished analysis" he performed for the National Corn Growers Association
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to look around in the CDC Obesity data to see if specific areas were disproportionately obese.
https://nccd.cdc.gov/BRFSSPrevalence/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DPH_BRFSS.ExploreByTopic&irbLocationType=StatesAndMMSA&islClass=CLASS14&islTopic=TOPIC09&islYear=2021&rdRnd=21856

The above link is for tables that show the number of samples taken and the percent of respondents that reported obesity.
The data goes back to 2011.

# Obesity is a chronic condition that takes years to manifest. What should I look for specifically?

I looked through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for historical data on the prices of soybeans and 
found two relevant data sets at the following link:
- https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commodity-costs-and-returns/

Both data sets are linked in this repository. The first dataset is called the "Recent Cost and Returns" for soybeans
The second data set is the "Historical Costs and Returns" for soybeans.
