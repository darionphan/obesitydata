1) Justin Mares - Substack Newsletter - Published 4 Aug 2022
https://justinmares.substack.com/p/the-next-episode-33

SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since 1995:
   - Corn subsidies total around $116 billion
   - Wheat subsidies total around $48 billion
   - Soybean subsidies total around $45 billion
- Because they are subsidized, they get planted more >> they get used more in food and animal feed
- Author suspects increase in gluten intolerance/allergies could be due to this
- Soybeans/vegetable oil more generally make up for 20% of American calorie consumption
  - Also used in animal feed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked through the sources and links in the news article and found an interesting Twitter thread by the author in which he talks about how vegetable oil can be detrimental to American health.
https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1329082510714671110?lang=en

The thread turned out to be a summary of a series of articles by Jeff Nobbs. Going through the articles, he makes a strong case for the role vegetable oils play in weight gain and other chronic diseases. 
Part 1 of 6 of the series is linked and the rest of the series is found at the end of each article.
https://www.jeffnobbs.com/posts/what-causes-chronic-disease

Since we are primarily focusing on obesity, parts 1, 2, 3, and 5 are the most relevant.

#can we use studies by country to see what other countries are consuming vegetable oil in the same quantities the US is?

Part 3 claim: Soybean oil accounts for about 45% of our dietary omega-6 (CHECK THIS LATER)

Links the increase in Omega-6/linoleic acid to weight gain
- There's a lot of evidence for this
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22334255/
- In the "Similar articles" section, there are other articles that state that linoleic acid causes weight gain
  - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24081493/
  - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22883314/
- Affects mortality

#Would transfat be a contributing factor?
#Possibly affect infant health via breast milk?
   # Article suspects the above
   
# Possible experiment?   
# Vegetable oil consumption as it gets introduced to new countries, 
# Maybe opening of borders to new fast food restaurants like McDonalds, KFC in China/other countries > weight gain?
   # This is kind of a subsidy, like "it is now legal to do business in China"
   # What if we looked at tariffs on vegetable oils and looked at the effect on weight?
   
- Article claims that that increase in the consumption of oil causes a reaction that makes us want to eat more (munchies) because people perceive themselves to be hungier
   - https://www.zeroacre.com/white-papers/how-vegetable-oil-makes-us-fat
      - This is part 5 of the 6 part series of articles. Part 1 is linked above. 
      
CLOSING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This established that there is a correlation between vegetable oil consumption and weight gain. 
Looking at vegetable oil consumption as it changes with farming subsidies is a direction for future exploration. 
We can also look at the opening of fast food in regions that did not previously have fast food and analyzing the weight gain from that. 
I think there are studies on that already with Middle Eastern countries and Pacific Island nations, but I'll have to double check that.

Looking more directly at the research question of the causes and consequences of obesity in the US, I think another direction we can take this is to analyze soy bean subsidies to farmers and the subsequent prices of soybeans. 
I'm pretty sure that subsidies will affect commodity prices but I'll need to verify that. 
I'll also probably need to understand the specifics of the subsidies to see if they are per-unit of lump-sum and if they are available in all regions of the US.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247588/

SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Past agricultural subsidies have incentivized the production of food like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) that lead to obesity
- The corn industry is advocating that corn subsidies is not the only reason for the increase in obesity
- Interesting legislation/papers/websites to look at that were mentioned in the article:
   - Agricultural Credits Act of 1923:
   - Freedom to Farm Act
   - Barry K. Goodwin 
      - https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2a4d353f16d3070afba07848be0403cf31b783f1
      - Agricultural subsidies increase farmland value
   ! Environmental Working Group (EWG) (they have data on a state-by-state basis) 
      ! https://farm.ewg.org/index.php
      # if we determine what areas have the subsidies, would that matter? The agricultural market seems pretty widespread,
      # so would we be able to determine if obesity would be localized to a specific area the subsidies are?   
      # When subsidies are announced/passed, we should see a drop in
- Prices of food are falling, people are becoming misnourished
- "About two-thirds of the HFCS consumed in the United States is in beverages"
- Bruce Babcock, Iowa State University Professor: 
   - "... if corn and soybeans were not subsidized, the price would rise at most by between five and seven percent"
   # It's "unpublished analysis" he performed for the National Corn Growers Association
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to look around in the CDC Obesity data to see if specific areas were disproportionately obese.
https://nccd.cdc.gov/BRFSSPrevalence/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DPH_BRFSS.ExploreByTopic&irbLocationType=StatesAndMMSA&islClass=CLASS14&islTopic=TOPIC09&islYear=2021&rdRnd=21856

The above link is for tables that show the number of samples taken and the percent of respondents that reported obesity.
The data goes back to 2011.

# Obesity is a chronic condition that takes years to manifest. What should I look for specifically?

I looked through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for historical data on the prices of soybeans and 
found two relevant data sets at the following link:
- https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commodity-costs-and-returns/

Both data sets are linked in this repository. 
The first dataset is called the "Recent Cost and Returns" for soybeans {DATA 001}
The second data set is the "Historical Costs and Returns" for soybeans {DATA 002}

After that, I looked through the USDA Open Data Catalog to see what data was available regarding subsidies
https://www.usda.gov/content/usda-open-data-catalog

# Some data cannot be accessed on the site and it redirects me to a "page not found" page
# Data sets that I think are interesting:
   # Farm Service Agency USDA Payments: https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/efoia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested-information/payment-files-information/index
      # It has the names and addresses of all payments to (presumably) farmers
      # It also has the type of payment, so if we wanted to isolate a certain subsidy it may be possible
   # State of Origin for USDA Foods in Fiscal Year 2012: https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-foods/state-origin-usda-foods
      # The link on the USDA Open Data Catalog was broken, so I googled the title and found the data at a different URL
      # A path I was thinking about taking would be as follows: 
         # 1) We look at total payments/subsidies for a crop like soybeans
         # 2) We look at USDA purchases of food from states
         # 3) We look at where USDA distributes the food to school lunch programs
         # 4) We look at the obesity rates of schools with a higher proportion of students that eat school lunches
         # Potential problems: It still doesn't implicate subsidies as the reason why students are obese. 
         # We'd have to see the criteria the USDA has for purchasing that type/amount from farmers to see if price is
         # a relevant factor. If price is a relevant factor that causes the USDA to purchase an unhealthier crop over
         # a healthier option, then we can say subsidies can drive obesity.

This is how the three main commodity programs work: https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-commodity-policy/title-i-crop-commodity-program-provisions
# What's interesting is that indiviuals with an annual Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) above $900,000 are ineligible to receive payments from commodity programs

I ended up looking up the process on how vendors can sell food directly to USDA which I found with this link: 
- https://www.ams.usda.gov/selling-food

Going through the website, I found documentation for purchases of "Grain & Oilseed"
- Clicking through "PCA Report" on Vegetable Oil materials, we can see:
   - This provides a business name, address, city, and zip code for each and every purchase 
   - Here is an example from Solicitation Number 2000009059:
      - https://www.ams.usda.gov//sites/default/files/2000009059%20-%20PCA%20Report.pdf
   # We might be able to cross reference this with data like {DATA 003}
      - Farm Service Agency USDA Payments for Wisconsin - Wyoming 2009:
         - https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/efoia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested-information/payment-files-information/index

CLOSING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agricultural subsidies have definitely increased the quantity of soybeans and other subsidized crops on the market.
- Something interesting is in the Table 2 of the first link in the email (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204371)
   - It states that the change in food consumption broken down by caloric intake have been made up for almost all by snacks (which includes HFCS-containing beverages)
      - There is conflicting research about whether or not HFCS usage itself is the main driver of obesity

Payments to farmers and the data that comes with it seems incredibly relevant. If a connection is able to be made between 
the payments and their respective farmer's ability to provide crops to the USDA, we may be able to show that the subsidies 
could drive obesity

3) David M. Cutler et al - American Economic Association - Summer 2003
https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204371

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obesity may be caused by the decreased time cost of food due to the mass preparation of food due to the division of labor
- It is due to technological change that makes the above possible
The theory implies several things:
   - Increased caloric intake is due to consuming more meals rather than more calories per meal
   - Consumption of mass produced food has increased
   - The groups that take advantage of the technological changes the most have had the biggest increases in obesity
The theory also considers food regulations across countries and the fact that consumers may have self-control problems due to the decreased cost

Obesity has increased in the time frame analyzed as is not the result demographic change
The paper creates an equation to calculate the steady state of calories that takes into the account for a variety of factors
- The equation can be seen on page 8 of the pdf (which is page 100 in the journal) along with definitions of each variable

Increased caloric intake, not decreased energy expenditure, is the primary driver of weight gain
The reduction in the time cost of food preparation causes an increase in consumption of food in the following ways:
   - Increase in the variety of foods consumed
   - Increase in the frequency of food consumption
   - Switch to a high-calorie food
   - Increase in overall consumption of food
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm going to look and see if I can find another avenue that connects the decrease in price of an input like HFCS and vegetable oil to their increased usage

# I need a way to connect the subsidies to obesity. Here's what I have so far:
# 1) Subsidies go to soybean farmers
# 2) Farmers produce more of the subsidized crop because they have a price floor 
   # Moral Hazard, the farmers will continue to produce this amount because in the case of negative demand shocks (ex. Chinese soybean tariffs) the gov't helps bear some of the burder
# 3) This cheaper-than-market-price production is picked up by the USDA

This is an article titled "Effect of Insurance Subsidies on Agricultural Land-Use"
- Increase in subsidies of a specific crop leads to increases in farmland-share of that crop
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9864581/
# Something interesting about the article is that under "Data Source and Variable Selection" it provides ideas we can use to design an experiment
# It takes data on the acres and their usage from the USDA Census of Agriculture and the Risk Management Agency for insurance coverage for crops
# Using this data they were able to create Table 1 which details the type of land and the farm's costs and revenues
# Definitely worth reading

# Another possible perspective:
   # Rather than focusing on subsidies, I think focusing on USDA's purchasing and distribution would be more effective

      # “Based on our study, as well as research that USDA and other researchers have conducted showing improvements in diet, 
      # the improved school meals standards have been a great public health success story,” said first author Kenney. “These 
      # healthier school meals are helping to protect the health of the children who have been placed at highest risk for poor 
      # health, and they reduce hunger while also reducing their risk of chronic diseases later in life.”
         # In the Discussion portion, the paper states that they "are unable to definitively state a causal relationship between
         # the HHFKA and the reversal in childhood obesity prevalance trends among children in poverty"
   # There has been extensive research on this legislation, as seen through some of the sources the authors cite
      # We can try to find a causal relationship using USDA purchases. We can see what purchases increased/decreased after the law was 
      # enacted, weakened, or strengthed as time passed. 
      # Once we find this, we can measure the obesity rate over time/location
         # I feel like we're getting away from the subsidy part of this though. It feels too much like we're focusing on the 
         # legislation rather than the subsidies. Is that okay?


# Questions to ask during meeting:
   # What are the next steps? Should I keep looking at the legislation? 
   # The timeline, what should be on it?

I found another possible way to record contract data, this is a database for federal contracts. However, I don't see too many things about actual food.
- https://www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php/en/

sam.gov is the website the USDA uses to award contracts
- sam.gov
- I looked through this link on sam.gov
   https://sam.gov/data-services/Contract%20Opportunities/Archived%20Data?privacy=Public

However, I only found non-food contracts. I don't think this has what we're searching for

Trying to match the subsidies with the PCA reports, I wasn't
ConAgra Brands gets a lot of subsidies. I used the 2016 data set for the states and the 2016 PCA Reports

I wasn't able to find any matches going through the PCA Reports. I'm not sure if I'm using an incorrect year, but I'll keep looking around.
- It's a lot through first name and only some things are on there. I combined it into one big tibble then searched it
- No results for the soybean producers show up

Below is a list of companies that won contracts for Vegetable Oil organized by Issued Date. I was thinking that we could record the companies that won the contract and 
try to detect subsidies another way.
# What if we looked at the winners of a contract and we looked at subsidy amount for each of the producers. We assume each person is competitive 
and wants to win the auction and we can assign a predicted winning percentage by subsidy amount and see if the outcomes are in line with predictions
- https://www.ams.usda.gov/open-purchase-request?field_term_grades_and_standards_target_id=1057&page=0

#NEED TO DO: Record the amount of the contract won, but I want to run this by Professor Hackmann before I dive deep.
#Reorganize the DD/Month/Year format to Year/Month/Day

- Incobrasa Industries picks up the majority of the contracts and provides the most amount of vegetable oil
   - They got a grant

   - Contracts generally have 1 or 2 bidders, it's not that competitive
   - Bids used to have up to 5 bidders which was more competitive than it currently is
   - 

- The problem isn't that they don't show up. The problem is that we're looking at the wrong step in the production chain
- We were looking at the processors who sell to the USDA in bulk rather than the producers who source to them
- The flow is farmers > companies > USDA
- I tried looking at the companies in the data, but they didn't show up because they didn't receive the subsidies
   - Makes sense, now we need a way to find how those companies source the subsidied soybeans

Report on Food Procurement by USDA's Farm Service Agency
- https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/40862/54250_aer766.pdf?v=5734.8




spatial and intertemporal changes in price
smooth consumption, affect business/political affiliation
- incentives
what do the farmers do, who do they send it to?
need to link to obesity
- may work spatially, but need to double check
USDA auction data, bidding structure
- lack of competition, composition of product
- specific policy > product sourced


TO DO:
- Organize Auction data by time, city, read PCA report
- Look at quantities, are there standard units
- Look at bids, winning bids/spreads
- Location, City, Year, Product
   - Aggregate sales/other data
- 2010, changes to purchases?
   - Narrow down what the 2010 program did
   - State specific policies, did they implement it?
   - Regions, programs
   - Control group
   - Time/space?
- Control group for other programs
   - Treatment group, 2010 districts
   - captured by nutrition, 
   - section 32/48 (double check) does not change its purchasing behavior
   - look at PCA report, see what it's for
   - see school district participation
FOIA usage

NSCH Codebook:
- https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/uccb/nschdict?s_variablelist=
- Variable name K11Q62 records whether or not anyone in the family has received free or reduced-cost breakfast or lunch at school
- Variable name K11Q61 records whether or not anyone in the family recieved food stamps or SNAP benefits
   - Will probably correlate a lot with K11Q62

- I wasn't able to find K11Q62 and K11Q61 in the available data in the NSCH database so I requested it. I also requested
the school districts of the respondents. 


HHFKA 
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961790/#R9
- Possible control group: wealthier areas with less children on the National School Lunch Program (NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP)
   - These areas have less children at or below the federal poverty line, meaning that the HHFKA wouldn't affect them as much
      - To what degree does it affect them would be school dependent because all schools serve lunches, but we would need to find
   - In the Discussion the study states, "We are unable to definitively state a causal relationship between the HHFKA and the 
   - reversal in childhood obesity prevalence trends among children in poverty, because of the infeasibility of using a 
   - randomized design for such a policy evaluation and because the data set did not have a variable to explicitly indicate 
   - participation in school meals"

# What if we were able to tie NSLP and SBP participation/adherence to lobbying?
   # flesh out later

- Healthy Eating Index
   - https://www.fns.usda.gov/CNPP/healthy-eating-index-hei
   - Measures diet quality, is used as an indicator for how nutritious a set of foods aligns with dietary guidelines

! School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study
   - https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-nutrition-and-meal-cost-study
   - Conducted in April 2019
      # Able to capture some of the updated nutritiion guidelines set by the HHFKA
   - A four-volume study that assesses school meal programs
   - Summary of findings:
      - https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/SNMCS_Summary-Findings.pdf
         #NOTE TO DARION: READ ALL OF THIS > Go to the important sections in the volumes and read more
   - Overview of findings with other studies done, will look over later
      - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073026/

# How do schools adhere to it? There must be district's discretion as to how they implement the policies
   # What accounts for the variation? Are some districts more likely to adhere than others?
