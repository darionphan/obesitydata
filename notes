Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Since 1995:
   - Corn subsidies total around $116 billion
   - Wheat subsidies total around $48 billion
   - Soybean subsidies total around $45 billion
- Because they are subsidized, they get planted more >> they get used more in food and animal feed
- Author suspects increase in gluten intolerance/allergies could be due to this
- Soybeans/vegetable oil more generally make up for 20% of American calorie consumption
  - Also used in animal feed

I looked through the sources and links in the news article and found an interesting Twitter thread by the author in which he talks about how vegetable oil can be detrimental to American health.

The thread turned out to be a summary of a series of articles by Jeff Nobbs. Going through the articles, he makes a strong case for the role vegetable oils play in weight gain and other chronic diseases. Part 1 of 6 of the series is linked and the rest of the series is found at the end of each article.

Since we are primarily focusing on obesity, parts #, #, #, and # are the most relevant to

#can we use studies by country to see what other countries are consuming vegetable oil in the same quantities the US is?
#is it omega-6 found in the vegetable oil?

Part 3 claim: Soybean oil accounts for about 45% of our dietary omega-6 (CHECK THIS LATER)

Links the increase in Omega-6/linoleic acid to weight gain
- There's a lot of evidence for this

- In the "Similar articles" section, there are other articles that state that linoleic acid causes weight gain
