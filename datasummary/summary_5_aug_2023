Hi Professor!

This is the summary of the data that is potentially available as well as the list of people to contact.

For the data, I divided it into 4 parts: misc, obesity, schoolpurchasing, and subsidy.
- misc: contains data that does not fall into the other three categories but is relevant
- obesity: contains data that deals with the distribution of obesity over time in different places
- schoolpurchasing: contains data that deals with how schools purchase food
  - There are no datasets regarding school purchasing in this yet because I haven't been able to find anything other than tables in reports
  - See overview to view what data we have
- subsidy: contains data that deals with subsidies given to producers 
  - There is no data in here, the data that was in 'datasets' was put into 'misc'

To answer your question about the relevant pages in a key paper that uses the data sources we're requesting, see the 
'existing_literature' file and go to 'USDA Reports' because the USDA has most/all of the data sources we need.

For the list of potential contacts, see the 'who_to_contact' page under 'datasummary' for all the details, but here's
the types of people we want to contact:
1) The USDA Project Officers of the studies or the USDA office directly
  - See if they can provide us the datasets that already exist
2) Public School Districts
  - See if they can provide us the documents they have
3) USDA Contact Page
  - Same as #1
4) Office of Research, Nutrition, and Analysis FNS USDA at (703) 305-2017 
  - Number that may allow us to obtain public-use datafiles
