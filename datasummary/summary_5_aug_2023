Hi Professor,

This is the summary of the data that is potentially available as well as the list of people to contact.

For the data, I divided it into 4 parts: misc, obesity, schoolpurchasing, and subsidy.
- misc: contains data that does not fall into the other three categories but is relevant
- obesity: contains data that deals with the distribution of obesity over time in different places
- schoolpurchasing: contains data that deals with how schools purchase food
  - There are no datasets regarding school purchasing in this yet because I haven't been able to find anything other than tables in reports
  - See overview to view what data we have
- subsidy: contains data that deals with subsidies given to producers 
  - There is no data in here, the data that was in 'datasets' was put into 'misc'

To answer your question about the relevant pages in a key paper that uses the data sources we're requesting, see the 
'existing_literature' file and go to 'USDA Reports' because the USDA has most/all of the data sources we need.
- I think that asking for everything then sifting through it would be better than asking for the datasets, but I'm 
  not sure what they want in the request, they probably want it to be specific
- I've only read two of the studies listed in the 'USDA studies', and the relevant tables are listed under 
'datasummary' > 'schoolpurchasing' > 'school_food_purchasing_study' > 'overview_and_relevant_tables'
  - What I did was summarize the tables and give a page number to locate them
    - Should I keep doing this of the other USDA FNS reports?
  - See the bottom of 'overview_and_relevant_tables', for an indepth answer, but I think the raw data rather than the data of 
  any specific table is what we are looking for

For the list of potential contacts, see the 'who_to_contact' page under 'datasummary' for all the details, but here's
the types of people we want to contact:
1) The USDA Project Officers of the studies or the USDA office directly
  - See if they can provide us the datasets that already exist
2) Public School Districts
  - See if they can provide us the documents they have
3) USDA Contact Page
  - Same as #1
4) Office of Research, Nutrition, and Analysis FNS USDA at (703) 305-2017 
  - Number that may allow us to obtain public-use datafiles 

Let me know if you need anything else and I'll keep working on reading the rest of the literature and summarizing it.


Best, 

Darion
