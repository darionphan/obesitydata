This is the file of the people that I think we should contact because they either are the point of contact for the school or 
the study with nice data to have. 


1) Freedom of Information Act, Food and Nutrition Service: FOIA-FNS@usda.gov
- https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division
- There are a lot of datasets that seem cool to have just based on the title of the study/report,
  but I haven't taken the time to read through the methodology. 
- They published the following studies that are relevant  
# Year published is in brackets
  - School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study [2019]
    - https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-nutrition-and-meal-cost-study
    # Study was done by an organization called Mathematica Policy Research, so I'm not sure if the USDA FNS has the raw data
    # of the individual schools
    # Will probably need a different email template because it's under the FOIA

- Ask if they have contract/bidding data

2) Public School Districts Requesting the Data
- See 'misc' for the list of school districts with 'unified' in the name
- The phone number is listed, so we can sort by a specific area we want to analyze, call the school, and request the SFA's email to request more info
  - Once the SFA's email is obtained, we can send the SFA an email asking for what they have
  - Ask for contract/bidding data. Also ask what methods they used to solicit the bids
