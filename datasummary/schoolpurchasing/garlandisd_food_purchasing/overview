I'm not currently sure how the files are organized. Let me figure that out real quick
- https://garlandisd.net/search?keys=bid+tab+food
- I think the first number is the category and the second number is the nth item in that category

I'm going to organize it by date of bid expiration. The original name is something like ##-##
