This document provides an overview of the data from the School Food Purchase Study published in 1998

The link to the executive summary, report, and uploaded appendices is provided here:

Although there are five parts of the report and five statistical appendices, the first appendix does not completely describe
the data mentioned in the first report. This is also true for the second through fifth report and appendix. 

As a result, below is a list of relevant tables with the correspondingly relevant part of the study

The table of contents is located in Part 1. The summary of what each table is can be found in the table of contents in Part 1.

Appendix 1:
- Table I: Individual Food Code Classification System
- Table II: Assignment of Individual Food Items to Food Groups and Subgroups
Appendix 2:
- Table III: Total Estimated Value of Individual Foods Acquired by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SY 1996/97
- Table IV: Total Estimated Weight in Pounds of Individual Foods Acquired by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SY 1996/97
Appendix 3:
- Table V: Comparison of Total Estimated Weight in Pounds of Individual Foods Acquired by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SYs 1984/85 and 1996/97
- Table VI: Number of Public Unified NSLP School Districts Reporting the Acquisition of Individual Food Items, SY 1996/97
Appedix 4:
- Table VII: Mean Cost Per Pound of Food Items Purchased by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SY 1996/97
- Table VIII: Value Per Thousand Students of Food Items Acquired by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SY 1996/97
Appendix 5:

Below is a list of tables with a small summary as well as commentary about its relevance
Each name for the table is its section number then the order in which it appears. Ex. Table VI-4 is the fourth table in the sixth section
- See Part 1 pdf pages 7 - 11 to see the list of tables as well as their section number

We're trying to see how the set up of the auction affects the pricing and procurement of the goods, but none of the tables answer it directly
- The interesting data is found in the raw data by sifting through the records of each school's procurement to see a relationship between 
  a factor and the pricing and purchasing of the good. The demographic data on whether or not the school is part of an FSMC, cooperative, or
  how large it is is important, but we need to ask for the raw data.
