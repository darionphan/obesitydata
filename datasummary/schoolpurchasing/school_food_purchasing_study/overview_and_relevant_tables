This document provides an overview of the data from the School Food Purchase Study published in 1998

The link to the executive summary, report, and uploaded appendices is provided here:
- https://www.fns.usda.gov/school-food-purchase-study-final-report

Although there are five parts of the report and five statistical appendices, the first appendix does not completely describe
the data mentioned in the first report. This is also true for the second through fifth report and appendix. 

As a result, below is a list of relevant tables with the correspondingly relevant part of the study

The table of contents is located in the the first appendix. The summary of what each table is can be found in the table of contents.

Appendix 1:
- Table I: Individual Food Code Classification System
- Table II: Assignment of Individual Food Items to Food Groups and Subgroups

- Table III: Total Estimated Value of Individual Foods Acquired by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SY 1996/97
- Table IV: Total Estimated Weight in Pounds of Individual Foods Acquired by Public Unified NSLP School Districts, SY 1996/97
Appendix 3:

Below is a list of tables with a small summary as well as commentary about its relevance
Each name for the table is its section number then the order in which it appears. Ex. Table VI-4 is the fourth table in the sixth section

### Do I need to do this? Check later, seems a bit tedious. Maybe just with the tables I think are relevant
Table I-1: Federal Government Reimbursement Rates for the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program. SY 1996/97
