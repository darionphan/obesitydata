https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/nu/rs/index.asp
- There are also grants and other funding sources schools can apply for
	# What reasons should they apply to this? 

https://www.ednc.org/school-meals-finance/
- Sources of funding for schools,
	- Reimbursements by federal government
		- Per meal served, depends on the type of meal served/severe-need
		- Commodity funding from USDA Foods in Schools Program
	- Student payments
		- Copayments, lunch purchases
		- Also a la carte items
	- State support
		- States participating in federally funded school nutrition programs must provide a certain amount of matching funds based on a set rate
		- https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/matching-funds
			- Varies by state, "the state (as distinguished from the State Educational Agency) can determine the extent 
			to which it is practicable for the state to disburse state revenue matching funds in such a manner that each school 
			food authority receives the same proportionate share of such revenues as it receives of specified federal assistance funds."
				- I interpret this as states match a certain percent of federal funds in the same proportion the federal government pays the schools
- Sources of costs for schools
	- Food/Food supplies
	- Labor
	- Equipment and overhead

https://nourishca.org/ChildNutrition/NSLP/CFPAPublications/NSLP-FactSheet-2008.pdf
- Program funded via Federal subsidies
- State reimburses school for all free/reduced price meals
- Commodities(entitlement foods), worth about 15.5 cents per meal served
- There's also a performance-based cash assistance

		- Can see claim summaries
			- 7 Claim statuses: Not Eligible, Incomplete, Pending, Error, Validated, Accepted, Processed
		- SFAs can combine/uncombine May/June as well as August/September claims

		- Edit Check: #I think this is a way for them to double check their numbers?
				#Annual attendance factor
			" To perform daily meal count edit checks, sponsors must:
			•	Multiply the number of enrolled children approved in each meal category (free, reduced-price, and paid) by the annual attendance factor
			•	Compare these numbers, known as attendance adjusted eligible figures, to the daily counts of free, reduced–price, and paid meals served
			•	Document your calculations on an edit check form (samples available from the CDE)
			•	Provide a written justification on the edit check form next to the date where any category count exceeds the attendance-adjusted number. (Sample justification could be meal participation increased due to a special promotion or it was “pizza day”.)

		- Commodity Donations
				- ENTITLEMENTS ARE NOT ROLLED OVER TO NEXT SCHOOL YEAR, Use it or lose it
			- DoD Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program
				- https://www.fns.usda.gov/f2s/using-dod-fresh-buy-local
				- The DoD Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procures the produce
				- Schools place orders via Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Order/Receipt System (FFAVORS)
					- Allows the schools to use entitlement to purchase fresh produce
					- Tracks entitlement balances and order costs
			- USDA Commodity Procurement/Delivery: https://www.ams.usda.gov/selling-food/how-process-works
				- This is what we looked at at the beginning of the summer
				- Process: USDA via its Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announces plan to buy particular food
					- AMS solicits via Web Based Supply Chain Management (WBSCM)
					- Approved vendors respond > Contracts are awarded
					- Once the contractor "has successfully performed on their contract" an invoice is submitted to WBSCM
				- FEDERAL > STATE; https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-fis/determining-school-and-child-care-commodity-entitlements
					- FNS, AMS, and FSA decide which commodities will be purchased "based on a consolidated purchase plan"
						- Accounts for " overall program entitlements to states, traditional usage in previous years, state 
						and school preferences, anticipated market conditions, and the amounts and types of funds appropriated" 
					- "Overall commodity entitlements are determined based on the estimated number of lunches served between 
					July 1 and June 30 of each year in schools participating in the NSLP. The entitlements are obtained by multiplying 
					the estimated number of meals served in the current year by the value of commodities assistance for each lunch. The 
					value per lunch specified by Section 6(c) of the NSLA is a three-month average value of the Price Index for Food Used 
					in Schools and Institutions for March, April, and May of each year, is updated annually and published in the Federal Register."
					- Group A foods: Surplus removal type foods that are generally available seasonally. 
						- Includes: fruits, vegetables, poultry, fish, and meat
						- Generally offered when a purchase is expected to be made;
						- State can choose to accept all or part of its share or can refuse them. If additional items are made available, they are offered later in place of the refused commodities
					- Group B foods: Acquired by FSA
						- Generally price supports, includes dairy products, cereals, grains, peanut products, and vegetable oil products
						- "Each year, states choose the percentage of Group B commodities they desire. Normally, this percentage remains 
						the same for the entire school year. However, if unusual situations occur, states are given the opportunity to 
						change their percentage of Group B commodities. states are provided a list of available Group B foods and the 
						estimated cost of each item. States may order these foods throughout the year."
					- Bonus commodities: Donated to schools when there are surpluses, offered on a 'fair-share' basis

				- STATE > SCHOOL
				- Distribution to Schools: https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-fis/offering-school-food-authorities-required-value-and-variety-usda-foods-and-efficient-and-cost
					- State Distribution Agencies (SDA) offer "to the extent practical, the full variety of USDA Foods that the USDA makes available in NSLP
						- Up to the SDA to distribute it
						- https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/nu/fd/offeringinfo.asp
						- "An agency's donated food entitlement is calculated 
						by the number of reimbursable lunches served during the previous year 
						(July 1–June 30) multiplied by the current per-meal value"		
							- SFAs submit orders periodically throughout the school year to the extent that entitlements allow
							- Bulk foods are also mae available to be ordered and/or delivered to a processor
							- Up to the SDA to contract with the processors to let SFAs get the food they want/ask for
							- Ways to distribute the food
								- Direct shipment of USDA Foods to SFA
								- Split shipments between different SFAs if an SFA's order does not consitute a full truckload
								- Collective receipt and storage
									- Co-ops can order, receive, and store USDA Foods							
				-https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/nu/fd/dist.asp
				- State Distribution Centers (SDCs): One in Sacramento, one is Pomona
				- Recipient agencies(RA) recieve USDA Foods through SDCs
					-RAs have full control over entitlement spending and scheduling; they can place 5 orders per year based on what's available at the SDC
					-Advance Order Program: Before the school year, Large RAs can order raw bulk USDA Foods to divert directly to processors
					-State Co-op Program: Before the school year, RAs submit a survey and can order specific USDA Foods to be received at the SDC
						
				

			- USDA Foods Processing: https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-fis/processor
				- "USDA Foods processing allows state distributing agencies and eligible recipient agencies, 
				such as school districts, to contract with commercial food processors to convert raw bulk 
				USDA Foods into more convenient, ready-to-use end products."
				- USDA provides these foods for processing: https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-fis/processor-material-prices
					- Has price, UOM, Quantity, Description, truck weight
				- https://www.fns.usda.gov/usda-fis/further-processing-factsheet
				- Benefits include: "Stretch their USDA Food dollars by ordering bulk products at lower-cost;
						     Help ensure food safety by limiting handling of raw product in school foodservice operations;
						     Reduce labor costs and cash outlays for food preparation;
						     Reduce storage and delivery costs; and
						     Have their bulk USDA Foods delivered directly from USDA vendors to their contracted processor(s).
				- Value is passed through to the recipient agency in the form of lower costs of the finished product
					- 3 ways to ensure the value of the USDA Foods contained in the finished product is return to the recipient agency
						- Discounting the normal commercial price
						- Paying a refund to the school
						- Charging a fee for service for converting the USDA Foods
				- A lot of processors, varies from year to year, but averages at about "100 processors participating in more than one state"
				- Contracts differ between processors, will probably need to analyze individual contracts
