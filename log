22 June 2023
I looked at https://justinmares.substack.com/p/the-next-episode-33 and determined that I want to focus on vegetable oil.

As a result, I will try to find evidence for subsidies/other causal factors that lead to an increase is vegetable oil consumption

I also created the GitHub and made the notes and log files.
